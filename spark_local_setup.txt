(1) Install Spark via https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html


(2) Verify Spark installation and location
/Users/miaolin/Downloads/spark-3.5.6-bin-hadoop3

(3) Add Spark's bin directory to your $PATH
I have tried to run below code in terminal but no luck. Add the bin dir manually
export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark-<version>-bin-hadoop<version>"
export PATH="$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH"

	a.Edit your .zshrc file:
		nano ~/.zshrc
	b.Add the following lines at the end of the file, replacing /path/to/spark-<version>-bin-hadoop<version> with the actual path you located in the previous

export SPARK_HOME="/Users/miaolin/Downloads/spark-3.5.6-bin-hadoop3"
export PATH="$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH"

	c. Close and save 
(4) Apply the changes. Run this in terminal
source ~/.zshrc

(5) Run spark-shell, you should see Spark shell prompt
